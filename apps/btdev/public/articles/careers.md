# Careers

## fortisiem

> from: Oct 1, 2016

> to: now

> title: Principal Software Development Engineer

> company: Fortinet, Inc.

> location: Sunnyvale, California

> website: https://www.fortinet.com/

> use:Javascript, TypeScript, CSS, LESS, HTML, AngularJS, Bootstrap, D3.js, JSReport, Node.js, jest, gulp, Webpack, Python, Bash

> did: Responsible for the initial framework design, setup, and technical decisions. Developed various components for use by other developers. Led the completion of multiple sub-modules. Continued to add new features and provide maintenance.

-   In 2016, Fortinet acquired AccelOps and I transitioned to the new company. AccelOps was rebranded as FortiSIEM.
-   This was my first commercial AngularJS project, and so far the only one.
-   This project was migrated from AccelOps' Flex client to FortiSIEM's HTML client. Although there is no evidence, I believe that this migration played a role in AccelOps' acquisition.
-   I started building the foundation of this project while at AccelOps. Because I didn't expect it to be used for that long, the project still contains some experimental code from the early stages, which occasionally causes challenges in current maintenance work.
-   The project is based on AngularJS. When the project transitioned from the experimental phase to full development, Angular 2.0 was released (end of 2016). We have yet to complete the migration from AngularJS to Angular, which I consider to be another potential risk for the project.

## accelops

> from: Aug 1, 2010
> to: Sep 1, 2016
> title: Senior Software Engineer, Tech Lead
> company: AccelOps, Inc.
> location: Shanghai, China
> website: https://www.accelops.com/

> use: ActionScript 2 & 3, Flex 4, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python

> did: Resolved various UI/UX issues during interface design, feature construction, and visualization implementation. Developed UI components for specific environments. Created internal development debugging tools.

-   This is the last project I developed using ActionScript/Flex. Not long after, Flash faded from people's view.
-   I have always believed that Flex is a very excellent framework, even now (2024), there are still many commendable aspects. Unfortunately, Adobe failed to lead effectively, and with Google's pressure, it was only natural for Flash to be pushed off the stage.
-   I am good at developing UI components using ActionScript, as alternatives to native Flex UI components, and adding various custom functions based on project requirements.
-   I like to use Flex to develop my own debugging tools, especially for API debugging. Since our product is based on the network, by capturing all API call data and sending it to my own debugging tool, it greatly reduces my debugging time.

> did: Responsible for the continuous maintenance and functionality improvement of web games.

-   This is the only game company I have worked for. From the first day I started as a programmer, I wanted to make games. This is the closest I have been to making games. Although it was only for a short six months.
-   When I joined the company, it was just before it lost the agent of WoW in China. The company's development atmosphere gave off a sense of urgency.

-   At 51Job, I don't directly work on any webpage design and development. I guide other designers to create recruitment websites for clients.
-   I have had exposure to many technologies related to web and websites, but none in depth, as it is not helpful for "making recruitment websites."
-   I even created some small games internally in the company (during the peak of Flash games), and we also tried to turn the employee training system into a game.
-   The reason I left is that there is no value in deepening the learning of any technology here.

## topcmm

-   My first job in Shanghai, and the longest daily work hours job so far.
-   Most of our customers are outside of China, and a significant portion of them provide video chat support for dating or adult websites.
-   Our product was already developed before I joined the company, but it was using the earliest versions of ActionScript and Flash. I spent a long time rewriting a lot of content, but I didn't stick with it to completion.
-   At that time, RIA was just starting to become popular, and I believed that Flex would be the future of RIA. My programming mentality was primarily formed during this period.

## tiandi

> from: July 1, 2004
> to: July 1, 2005
> title: Web and Flash Developer
> company: Tiandi Company (closed)
> location: Wuhan, China
> website:

> use: PHP, JSP, Delphi, Flash, ActionScript 2, JavaScript, VBScript, Java (Java Servlet), Dreamweaver, Fireworks

> did: Part of the team that created an online community and friends aggregation platform. Working on finding the appropriate technical combination and approach for the product.

-   My first job after college graduation. When I entered the company, there were three of us including me. The first month's salary was 800 RMB (about 110 USD).
-   At that time, Facebook had just launched, and MSN Space was also exploring business models. These were our competitors at the time.
-   Within a short six months, we tried various technologies for client development, including traditional technologies such as PHP, JSP, Delphi for thin clients, as well as new technologies like Java Servlet, JavaScript, VBScript for rich clients. Eventually, we chose to develop clients on the Flash platform.
-   By the time I left, the company had not completed the development of the first version of the product. Choosing a relatively new technology that required solving many problems was one of the reasons for failure.
